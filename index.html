          <h3 class="timeline-heading" id="headline">Here's a timeline of Jonas Salk's life:</h3>
          <li>
            Jonas Salk was born the 28<sup>th</sup> of October in 1914 to Daniel and Dora Salk in New York City. His father was born in New Jersey to eastern European parents, and his mother Dora had immigrated as a child from Russia &ndash; both were of Ashkenazi Jewish heritage.
          </li>
          <li>
            At the age of thirteen, Jonas entered Townsend Harris High School. Then at only fifteen, he went on to the City College of New York, where he earned a Bachelor of Science in chemistry, in 1934.
          </li>
          <li>
            At medical school, he made it clear that he did not intend to go on to practice medicine: instead, he wanted to help people in the broader sense, not individually. He was first truly introduced to virology while working in the lab of Thomas Francis, first in medical school and again during his residency at the prestigious Mount Sinai Hospital.
          </li>
          <li>
            In 1947, Salk mamaged to acquire a lab of his own at the University of Pittsburg School of Medicine, though he found it too small, and the rules imposed by the university too restrictive. The following year he was offered a larger research space by Harry Weaver &ndash; the director of research at the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis &ndash; in order to whether there were more types of the polio virus than the three then known.
          </li>
          <li>
            Widespread public knowledge and fear of the polio virus afforded its research a large sum of funding, but most other researchers had focused on vaccines containing a dangerous live instance of the disease. Jonas Salk's research instead attempted a cure with a safer "killed" virus.
          </li>
          <li>
            Following successful animal testing, Salk's team injected 43 children at the Watson Home for Crippled Children with his killed-virus vaccine on the 2<sup>nd</sup> of July, 1952. Following further encouraging testing, he brought his vaccine in 1954 to some one million children who became known as the "polio pioneers."
          </li>
          <li>
            Salk's vaccine, the first successful cure for polio, came into full use in 1955. It has since been included on the World Health Orgnization's List of Essential Medicines, those considered crucial in any health system.
          </li>
          <li>
            Jonas ultimately chose not to file a patent for his polio vaccine: he wished for it to be spread wide and far, with minimal concern for personal profit.
          </li>
          <li>
            With the success of the polio vaccine, Salk became a celebrity across the world, much to his chagrin. For all the opportunities that his fame provided him, he felt burdened by the public's adulations and wanted simply to return to his lab.
          </li>
          <li>
            In 1963, he opened the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California. He hoped to provide young scientists with some of the opportunities he had missed out on himself, and also to bring together the estranged disciplines of the sciences and the humanities.
          </li>
          <li>
            Jonas Salk died at the age of 80, on the 23<sup>rd</sup> of June, 1995.
          </li>
